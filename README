TileFall will create a directory in your home directory called '.games' and a
file in that directory called 'tilefallrc'. On Win32 machines it will create
a file called 'TILEFALL.INI' in the directory it is invoked from.


4. INSTALLATION

Note that TileFall can be installed pretty well anywhere - the only restriction
is that all the files must be together in the same directory.

# Create the directories.
mkdir /usr/games
mkdir /usr/games/tilefall

# Copy the tar.gz to the game directory.
cp tilefall-VERSION.tar.gz /usr/games

# Change to the games directory.
cd /usr/games

# Unpack the archive using method A or B:
# Method A for those using GNU tar
tar xvfz tilefall-VERSION.tar.gz
# Method B for those not using GNU tar
gunzip tilefall-VERSION.tar.gz
tar xvf tilefall-VERSION.tar

# Change to the tilefall directory.
cd tilefall

# The tar should have done this automatically: 
mkdir Tk
mv MesgBox.pm Tk/

# Make sure tilefall is executable.
chmod a+x tilefall

# Optional for Debianites. If you want tilefall to appear on your X menu do
# the following:
cp debian-menu /etc/menu/tilefall
update-menus
# Note that the name of the file supplied, 'debian-menu', is changed in the
# move to 'tilefall'. Note also that if you haven't used the paths given here you
# must change the command path in /etc/menu/tilefall. The addition to the menu
# will only appear when the window manager is restarted.

# To run tilefall from the command line:
/usr/games/tilefall/tilefall &

# You could always either alias this or use a soft link to a directory on the
# path to save typing the whole path.
